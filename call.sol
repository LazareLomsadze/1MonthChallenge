// The `call` method stands as the most versatile way to send Ether and interact with other contracts.
It allows for forwarding all available gas or specifying a gas limit, 
and provides a boolean return value indicating the success or failure of the transfer. Here’s an example of using the `call` method:


``solidity
function sendEtherUsingCall(address payable _to) public payable {
(bool sent, bytes memory data) = _to.call{value: msg.value}(“”);
require(sent, “Failed to send Ether”);
}
```

//  After December 2019, the `call` method became the recommended approach for sending Ether. 
It grants more control over gas usage and facilitates complex interactions between contracts.
However, it’s crucial to implement appropriate security measures to guard against re-entrancy attacks.
