In Solidity, bytes4 is a fixed-size byte array type that is 4 bytes (32 bits) in length. It is commonly used to represent function selectors.

A function selector is the first four bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the function's signature. It is used in Ethereum to uniquely identify functions in a contract. When you call a function in a contract, you include the function selector in the transaction data to specify which function you want to invoke.

For example, let's say you have a function myFunction(uint256, address) in your contract. The function selector for this function is the first four bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the string "myFunction(uint256,address)". This is what allows Ethereum to correctly route the function call to the appropriate function within the contract.

In Solidity, you typically use bytes4 when working with function selectors, like in the example you provided:

function getSelector(string calldata _func) external pure returns (bytes4) {
  return bytes4(keccak256(bytes(_func)));
}
Here, getSelector takes a string _func, calculates the Keccak-256 hash of it, and then casts the result to a bytes4 before returning it. This function essentially generates the function selector for the provided function signature.
