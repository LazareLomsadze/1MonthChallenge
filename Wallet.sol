// 1️⃣ Web Wallets: 🌐
// These wallets operate through web browsers and are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. They are convenient but require users to trust the wallet provider with their private keys.

// 2️⃣ Desktop Wallets: 💻
// Installed directly on your computer, desktop wallets offer enhanced security by allowing you to control your private keys. They provide an offline storage option, protecting your assets from online threats.

// 3️⃣ Mobile Wallets: 📱
// Designed for smartphones, mobile wallets provide a convenient way to manage Ether on the go. They offer a balance between accessibility and security, with options to back up and secure your private keys.

// 4️⃣ Hardware Wallets: 🔒
// These physical devices are considered one of the most secure options for storing Ether. They store private keys offline, providing an extra layer of protection against potential hacking attempts.

// 5️⃣ Paper Wallets: 📃
// A paper wallet is a physical document that contains your private and public keys in a printed form. While they may seem archaic, they offer offline storage and can be highly secure if generated in a trusted environment.

// 6️⃣ Hybrid Wallets: 🔄
// These wallets combine multiple wallet types to offer a broader range of features. For example, a hybrid wallet might integrate a hardware device with a mobile app for convenience and security.
