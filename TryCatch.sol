// Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, offers a powerful error handling mechanism known as try-catch.

// Handling Errors in External Function Calls ⚙️

// One of the primary use cases of try-catch in Solidity is handling errors that may arise during external function calls. 📞 In the provided code sample, we have two contracts, `Foo` and `Bar`. The `Bar` contract utilizes an instance of the `Foo` contract to demonstrate the try-catch mechanism with external function calls. Let’s analyze the code snippet and its output. 🔄

function tryCatchExternalCall(uint _i) public {
 try foo.myFunc(_i) returns (string memory result) {
 emit Log(result);
 } catch {
 emit Log("external call failed");
 }
}

// In the `tryCatchExternalCall` function, we attempt to call the `myFunc` function of the `foo` contract instance. If the call succeeds, the returned result is emitted via the `Log` event. However, if an error occurs, such as a failed `require` statement, the catch block is executed, and the “external call failed” message is emitted. This way, you can handle errors and provide appropriate feedback to users or other contracts interacting with your smart contract. 🚀
