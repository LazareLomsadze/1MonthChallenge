//  The `send` method closely resembles `transfer`, but it provides a boolean return value to indicate the success or failure of the transfer. Similar to `transfer`, it also sends a fixed amount of gas (2300 gas) and reverts if the transfer fails. Here’s an example of using the `send` method:

```solidity
function sendEtherUsingSend(address payable _to) public payable {
bool sent = _to.send(msg.value);
require(sent, “Failed to send Ether”);
}
```

//  Despite the `send` method providing a return value, it is no longer recommended for sending Ether due to potential re-entrancy attacks and the limited gas provided. It is advisable to use the `call` method instead.
